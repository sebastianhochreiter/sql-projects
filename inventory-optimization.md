# Inventory Optimization

## Detailed Project Description
The Inventory Optimization project was initiated to enhance operational efficiency by balancing inventory holding costs with product availability. By ensuring that we have just the right amount of stock, the project aimed to create a more agile and cost-effective inventory system.

### 1. The Business Challenge
- Inventory costs are a major operational expense for the company. Having excessive inventory leads to higher holding costs, while insufficient inventory could result in lost sales and disappointed customers. The challenge was to find the optimal point that minimizes costs while maximizing availability.

### 2. The Technical Challenge
- From a technical standpoint, this meant identifying the optimal reorder levels for each product in our portfolio.
- Requirements included an up-to-date SQL database containing inventory levels, frequency of sales for each product, and the average time taken for products to be resupplied.

### 3. The Process
- Extracted inventory and sales data from the SQL database.
- Developed SQL queries to calculate the average sale rates for each product and the corresponding stock levels.
- Computed key metrics like Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) and Reorder Point using SQL queries and incorporated seasonality adjustments.
- Used Excel for data visualization to make the findings more understandable for the procurement team.
- Technologies used were SQL for data extraction and querying, and Excel for data analysis and visualization.

### 4. The Results
- Based on our analysis, we successfully reduced the average inventory holding costs by 20% while maintaining a 99% in-stock rate.
- The procurement team was able to implement the new reorder levels, making the inventory system more agile and responsive.
- This optimization led to a more efficient use of warehouse space and improved cash flow, thus delivering substantial value to the business.
