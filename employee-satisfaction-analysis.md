# Employee Satisfaction Analysis

## Detailed Project Description
This project involved analyzing employee survey data to gauge satisfaction levels and understand areas for improvement in the work environment. By doing so, the project aimed to boost employee morale, which in turn would lead to increased productivity.

### 1. The Business Challenge
- Employee satisfaction is intrinsically tied to productivity and, ultimately, company success. A happier workforce is more likely to be engaged and contribute meaningfully.
  
### 2. The Technical Challenge
- The business challenge was converted into a technical one by determining the need to analyze survey results stored in an SQL database.
- Requirements included filtering the data based on departments, job roles, and other demographics, as well as creating aggregated metrics like mean satisfaction scores.

### 3. The Process
- Extracted employee survey data from the companyâ€™s SQL database.
- SQL queries were employed to filter the dataset based on various dimensions like departments, job roles, and tenure.
- Calculated aggregated metrics using SQL and used Python for advanced statistical analysis, including correlations between satisfaction levels and other variables.
- Technologies used were SQL for querying and Python for in-depth statistical analysis.

### 4. The Results
- The analysis revealed particular departments with lower-than-average satisfaction scores.
- The findings led to actionable recommendations, such as targeted team-building activities and training programs.
- As a result, a follow-up survey showed a 10% improvement in overall employee satisfaction scores.
