# Customer Retention Analysis

## Detailed Project Description
The Customer Retention Analysis project was designed to dig deep into customer behavior and trends to understand the factors that contribute to customer churn and retention. The goal was to provide actionable insights to the marketing team to improve customer relations and, ultimately, revenue.

### 1. The Business Challenge
- Customer retention is a key driver of profitability for any business. Acquiring a new customer is often more costly than retaining an existing one. Our challenge was to minimize customer churn by understanding the behavior and preferences of our existing customer base, thereby formulating strategies to improve customer relations.

### 2. The Technical Challenge
- This challenge translated into identifying and analyzing various metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) that could signal customer dissatisfaction or happiness. 
- Requirements included accessing a SQL database containing customer transaction data, profiling customers based on frequency and types of transactions, and then using this data for predictive analysis.

### 3. The Process
- I extracted the required datasets from the company's SQL database, focusing on attributes like customer ID, transaction date, product categories, and transaction amounts.
- SQL queries were used to segment customers based on frequency of purchases, average spending, and time since last purchase.
- Additional statistical measures were derived, such as Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and Net Promoter Score (NPS), through SQL queries.
- We then used Python and data visualization tools to plot these metrics over time.
- Technologies involved included SQL for data querying, Python for statistical analysis, and Tableau for data visualization.

### 4. The Results
- Our analysis unveiled that a significant segment of customers hadn't made any purchases in the last six months, and these customers generally had lower NPS scores.
- Armed with this data, the marketing team initiated targeted email campaigns with special offers and loyalty benefits. 
- The result was a 14% return rate of customers who were previously categorized as 'churned', thereby generating additional revenue and improving customer relationships.
