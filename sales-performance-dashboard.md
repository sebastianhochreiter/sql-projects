# Sales Performance Dashboard

## Detailed Project Description
The Sales Performance Dashboard project aimed to provide real-time insights into sales data for decision-makers. By making this data easily accessible and interpretable, the project sought to improve the agility and effectiveness of sales strategies.

### 1. The Business Challenge
- Sales are the lifeblood of any company. Quick, data-driven decisions can make the difference between exceeding targets and falling short. Our goal was to make key sales metrics readily available to decision-makers.

### 2. The Technical Challenge
- Translating business needs to technical requirements, the project required us to aggregate sales data from multiple sources and present it in a user-friendly manner.
- Requirements included extracting data from an SQL database, developing queries to calculate sales KPIs, and creating a real-time dashboard.

### 3. The Process
- We used SQL queries to pull current and historical sales data, focusing on metrics such as revenue, profit margins, and conversion rates.
- These queries were scheduled to run at regular intervals to keep the dashboard updated.
- Data was visualized using Power BI, offering various drill-down and filtering options.
- Technologies involved were SQL for data extraction and Power BI for dashboard creation.

### 4. The Results
- The real-time dashboard is now used by both sales and executive teams for day-to-day decision-making.
- The immediate availability of key metrics has reduced the decision-making time by approximately 30%, allowing for quicker reactions to market changes.
